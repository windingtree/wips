## Simple Summary

If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the WIP.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for gathering support within the community. Please explain how your WIP is intended to advance WindingTree and / or the associated Protocols, and how it’s aligned with WindingTree's values.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in the WindingTree DAO.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
